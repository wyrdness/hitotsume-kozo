## Conclusion

Hitotsume-kozo stands as one of Japanese folklore's most recognizable and endearing yokai—a creature whose potentially frightening appearance belies a largely harmless, curious nature. As a child-monk with a single eye, it embodies multiple layers of meaning: the Buddhist concept of inner vision, the social processing of physical difference, and the liminal space between childhood innocence and supernatural otherness.

In modern Japan, hitotsume-kozo has evolved from a figure meant to startle (and perhaps teach) into a cultural icon, appearing in everything from horror manga to cute mascots. This transformation reflects broader changes in how Japan relates to its yokai heritage—from fear and superstition to nostalgia and cultural pride.

Whether understood as:
- Actual supernatural entity
- Psychological projection of anxieties about difference
- Cultural mechanism for processing the "other"
- Literary and artistic creation
- Childhood folklore figure

Hitotsume-kozo continues to fascinate, embodying the playful, mischievous side of the yokai world while reminding us that appearances—even a single, staring eye—don't necessarily indicate malevolence.
